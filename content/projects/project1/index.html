<h1>Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination</h1>
<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It looks like salary is positively correlated with experience for both genders. But as the correlation figures suggest, the positive correlation is stronger for female than for male employees.
Finally, given that correlation between salary and experience is 0.803, the salary gap between the two groups may be due to the experience difference among genders instead of being a result of gender discrimination.</p>
